Aim:
- small board with a PT4115 LED constant current source -> up to 1.2 A
- dimmable with a 5V PWM signal (PWM frequency up to 50 kHz acc. to datasheet)
- single sided so it can be mounted to a heat sink (using 2 M4 Bolts)
- connected using pin header (0.1") of soldered directly


ToDo:
- some measurements...
